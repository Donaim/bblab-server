Here are a bunch of useful commands that I can never remember off the top of my head.



# for converting from python 2 to 3
sudo $(which 2to3-3.7) -w filename.py 
      
# for restarting the webserver nicely so that code changes will take place.
sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl -k graceful               

# helps will creating tools.
sudo $(which python3.7) /alldata/bblab_site/manage.py startapp tool_name       

# for opening the debug log
sudo vi /alldata/bblab_site/logs/debug.log

# this debug log handles internal server errors (usually when python files don't pass the beginning compile-like step)
vi /etc/httpd/logs/ssl_error_log

# For updating any django apps like the wiki. (usually you run this for database structure changes)
# If you don't haven't set up database access I think this won't work.
sudo $(which python3.7) /alldata/bblab_site/manage.py migrate
