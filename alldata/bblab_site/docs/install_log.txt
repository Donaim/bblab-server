This log shows certain software which has been installed on this machine, (besides the defaults,) and has to be maintained.

My goal is to keep this list as small as possible.

Programs Installed:
- Anaconda v5.3, 3.7 version - 2018-10-20
- R v3.5.2 - 2019-03-26

- Needed to install a newer version of gcc to run a connection utility (mysqlclient) to a newer version of mariadb.
(2019-08-04)

# (Uninstalling this should be fine)
gcc Install Commands:
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install devtoolset-7-gcc*
scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
which gcc
gcc --version

# (THIS WAS THE PROBLEM!)
Fix mariadb-devel (name-error):
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libmariadbclient.a /usr/lib64/libmariadb.a

# (THIS IS A CORRUPTED INSTALLATION BECAUSE OF LAST COMMAND)
Reinstalling mysqlclient:
sudo /usr/local/bin/python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall mysqlclient

### REAL MYSQLCLIENT FIX

# undo maraidb-devel fix
sudo mv /usr/lib64/libmariadb.a /usr/lib64/pause-libmariadb.a

### uninstall maraidb devel
sudo yum erase MariaDB-devel.x86_64

### install mysql devel
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install mysql-community-devel.x86_64

# Reinstall mysqlclient (This time it works!)
sudo $(which python3.7) -m pip install mysqlclient --force-reinstall --no-cache

- There is a version of python (2.7.5) pre-installed onto the webserver and it is being used to run https://github.com/phbradley/tcr-dist (which has been installed onto this version of python.) TODO: look into this tool in the future for when it upgrades to python 3
