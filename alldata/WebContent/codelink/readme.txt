Dependencies:
	The dependencies folder is broken into three different directories.
	
	Libraries:
		- This is for externaly sourced code.

	Utility Scripts:
		- This is for any self-made utilities.

	Operations:
		- Each operation (or tool) has its own module containing the main operation(s) of that tool.
		- Other tools can access that to make the code easier to reuse.
