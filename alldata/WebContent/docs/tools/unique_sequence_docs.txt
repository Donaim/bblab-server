Dependencies:
	Modules:
		- Built in to python -> sys, cgi, smtplib, re, email.mime.text.

		openpyxl dependencies:

		Note: I had problems installing openpyxl so I had to manually install its dependencies.

		- sequence_utils -> "/cgi-bin/python_dependencies/util_scripts/sequence_utils.py"
		- mailer -> "/cgi-bin/python_dependencies/util_scripts/mailer.py"

Directories:
	- "cgi-bin" holds all the python scripts and dependencies. ( These dependencies are intended to be shared between all programs. )
	- "unique_sequence" contains the html and css scripts for the website.
	
Algorithm:
	This tool consists of five main procedures:
		- 1.) Get website input from the form. (email, sequence data, etc...)
		- 2.) Iterate through all given sequences and fill a dictionary with data about each sequence that has not already been iterated over. ( Including saving the id of all identical sequences. )
		- 3.) Do the same as step 2 but convert the sequences to amino acid first.
		- 4.) Create an xlsx file using the "openpyxl" lib.
		- 5.) Email that file using the "mailer" util.

Access:
	- This tool is intended for anyone to use.
