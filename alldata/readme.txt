This file is describing the purpose of the directories here.

"bblab_site/" -> This directory is the django section of the webserver. It contains a wiki.

"hla_class/"  -> This directory contains the hla class tool. The djano part of the webserver isn't hosting this tool because it isn't written in python. There is a special case written in the apache server config file to host this file just using apache.
